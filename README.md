# BankCustomerClassification
In this project, we are analyzing the bank marketing data set with multivariate characteristics, classification is our associated tasks, the dataset has 45211 instances, and 17 attributes. The dataset was obtained from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository website ([Moro et al., 2014] S. Moro, P. Cortez and P. Rita. A Data-Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing. Decision Support Systems, Elsevier, 62:22-31, June 2014). The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.

The classification goal of this project is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y). With our output variable (desired target) being 'Subscribe', we developed the single logistic regression model using the confusion matrix, decision tree using the python scikit-learn package, and Simple SVM model to predict the probability of a customer to subscribe. The following input variables were used to help us predict weather a customer subscribes or not; age, job,marital, education, default, balance, housing and loan.
